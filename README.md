### Project 3 Interactive Work
For this assignment we had to create a interactive experience that addresses some kind of global issue. I chose the issue of the "death of third places". Which is the lack of places for people to hangout outside of work and school.
Unsure of how to make that issue I instead made a visual novel where you play as a college student looking for some sense of communitiy. But everywhere you go either lacks people or are closed.

Using Strudel.cc I was able to use Java Script to create music.

### Interaction Deep Dive (using processing)
Using simple code I was able to create a "drawing" application. It tracks your mouse movement to change the hue of the squares.

### Random Number Generator
A random number generator where the user tries to guess what number it is. Instead of numbers they are ducks! Duck image provided by Janell Baxter (my professor).

### Composition Creator
One of my first coding experiences. Where randomized shapes and colors would create different compositions. Also Learned how to include images into code.
